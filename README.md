# Color-Picker-Game
This a Learning project for HTML, JavaScript and CSS, this was great practice on the event handling and applying logic on the fly based on user interaction. 
The Functions and refactoring was also a very cool aread and isolating some funtions so we have a clear understanding about the solution, if i read this code in 10 weeks from now I will still have a full undestanding on how I have achieved this.

**HTML**
* SImple apprach (Advanced not required)
* DIVS
